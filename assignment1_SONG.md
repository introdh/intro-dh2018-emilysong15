## Written Response

Meghan Brett describes topic modeling as, "a form of text mining, a way of identifying patterns in a corpus" (Brett, JDH, 2012). From another perspective, Elijah Meeks and Scott Weingart referenced Will McCarty's idea that topic modeling is â€œa continual process of coming to know by manipulating representations" (Meeks and Weingart, JDH, 2012). Topic modeling allows researchers and the general public alike to discover unexpected patterns. It reflects movements in a corpus. This methodology is the basis for building discovery interfaces, which can be accessed to further intellectual growth and discussion. 

*The Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology* is a peer-reviewed, scholarly journal focused on current criminal law debates and issues. This includes research and theories directly related to societal concerns, expectations, and reform. The journal is widely respected among scholars and is one of the most read and cited publications in the legal realm. Its publishings encourage readers to debate and discuss the ongoing issues of today's world regarding crime and the justice system, furthering our ability to grow on both and intellectual and societal level. 

My interface seeks to uncover the major topics that are analyzed in *The Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology*, given the abundance of information the journal contains. More specifically, I want to understand how discussions and debates from 1910 to 2014 pertain to the problems of today. This is especially relevant given the recent and growing abuses of power and turmoil regarding police brutality and race. 

The data I selected initially included the entire *Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology* which covers topics from 1910 to 2014; however, once I began working in R Studio, this proved to be too much data for my computer. As a result, I processed only 1000 files of data by adjusting the "load_data" function code block. 

My topic model website contains 15 topics. I began with 25, and worked my way up to 40; however, this scope was too wide, making the topics broad, generalized, and difficult to interpret. On the other hand, 10 topics was limiting in terms of the information it revealed. 15 topics left room for categorization and interpretation. While the site still contains two topics I would throw out (as noted on the site), this number allows for a general but focused insight into the journal itself. 

These topics reveal trends throughout the journal regarding major points that are discussed and debated. The topics range from legal terms and government entities to families and race. They uncover elements of research within the journal with words including, variables, effects, research, table, model, and more. These findings also develop into patterns regarding race and location as they relate to crime and violence. Overall, this topic model illustrates how many variables are intertwined and connected in relation the criminal law and the justice system. From the layered nature of laws and crimes to the vast variety of people they impact, this topic model illustrates the complexity of criminology and criminal law.

Topic Modeling is a great way to uncover patterns and trends, especially with large sets of data and information; however, this methodology does have its limits. As Meghan Brett wrote, "topic modeling is not necessarily useful as evidence, but it makes an excellent tool for discovery" (Brett, JDH, 2012).  It is also important to remember that, when computing a topic model, the computer itself cannot interpret the words or their meanings. Elijah Meeks and Scott Weingart touch on this in their piece titled "The Digital Humanities Contribution to Topic Modeling." Scholars must exercise caution when using or analyzing topic models - they should focus on their strength of interpreting language itself rather than drawing explicit results from the topics overall. In many ways, topic modeling is a great starting place when it comes to research and intellectual growth, rather than developing a concrete conclusion. Topic modeling is one single element in the much larger process of learning.
