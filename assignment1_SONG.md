# Written Response

The 500-1500 word response should explain the data set, the initial findings, and how one would go about further exploring the data set/ findings/ arguments. In other words, the response should show that you understand what topic modeling is, how it works, and what we can learn from this method by way of applying it to a journal, which can be accomplished by addressing the following questions:

What is the scope of the journal?
What question(s) are you trying to answer?
Which data did you select for the corpus? Make sure to specify the kind of data and periodization.
Why the number of topics?
What are the initial findings and/or possible arguments? In other words, what do these topics tell us? Certain patterns? Trends?
Drawing on the readings, what are the possibilities and limitations of text analysis and topic modeling?

Citations: Use a modified format since citations will be drawn from course readings. Cite relevant readings using in-text/ parenthetical citations: (author, publication, date). Ex. (Blevins, personal blog, 09-09-2009) or (Goldstone and Underwood, JDH, 2012).

Meghan Brett describes topic modeling as, "a form of text mining, a way of identifying patterns in a corpus" (Brett, JDH, 2012). From another perspective, Elijah Meeks and Scott Weingart referenced Will McCarty's idea that â€œmodeling points the way to a computing that is of as well as in the humanities: a continual process of coming to know by manipulating representations" (Meeks and Weingart, JDH, 2012). Topic modeling allows researchers and the general public alike to discover unexpected patterns and a reflection of movements in a corpus. This methodology is the basis for building discovery interfaces, which can be accessed to further intellectual growth and discussion.
