## Part 2: Paper 

The 500-1500 word paper should address the following:

Describe the data you selected for your analysis. Assume the reader is unfamiliar with the data.
Explain the questions/ arguments your network generates about your data.
Drawing on the constraints, critiques and ideas in our readings, discuss the possibilitie and limits of network analysis as applied to your network and for network analysis generally. Make sure to cite the readers.

For the supreme court data, we are looking at co-citation networks, which means two cases are connected by an edge if 5 or more cases cite the cases together. We do this because otherwise the network will overrepresent cases that include a lot of citations.

The netowrk must compare at least 2 sets of casses. Make sure in the paper to explain why you picked the cases that are being comparing.

Citations: Use a modified format since citations will be drawn from course readings. Cite relevant readings using in-text/ parenthetical citations: (author, publication, date). Ex. (Blevins, personal blog, 09-09-2009) or (Goldstone and Underwood, JDH, 2012).

Networks are a collection of points joined together singly or in pairs by lines. These points are knowns as nodes (or vertices) and the connecting lines are vertices. Edges represent a relationship between points and are a directed and asymmetric edge - there is a specific direction from node to node that reveals information about their relationship. A degree respesents the number of edges connected to a node. Networks can be bimodal/bipartite with two types of nodes and multimodal with multiple nodes. A community within a network refers to the most relevant nodes to a specific node (Weingart, JDH, 2012). 

The data used to create this network was derived from a set of U.S. Supreme Court cases from 1754 to 2002. This entire data set contains 30,288 majoritity rulings each of which were assigned a corresponding legal issue. 

This specific network includes data from issues regarding The First Ammendment, miscellaneous (cf. comity: First Amendment) and comity: First Amendment, with issue numbers 30010 and 90030 respectively. Based on this data, the created network provides insights into how these cases and precedents are connected through co-citations, in which two cases are connected with an edge when five or more other cases cite them together. The cases themselves appear as nodes. 

Networks themselves have limits and should be acknowledged in order to better understand what this data set means and doesn't reveal. There is both power and drawbacks in simplicity. As a result, this limitation can be reducing at times and drop out certain complexities. Networks also flatten time and do not always reveal varying degrees of importatnt. Networks can also be limited by small demographics; however, this does not necessarily apply this specific network as it contains such a large and widespread data set. Overall, these complexities make it less clear what can be fully learned from networks (Weingart, JDH, 2012). Despite these limits, networks also create other possibilities. Large amounts of data may not be ideal for other types of methods, but it is for networks. Adding mapping can also reveal changes over time (Newman, Oxford Scholarship Online, 2010). Regardless of their limitations, networks as a whole can offer great insights into data sets, and uncover hidden ways that they are connected.
