## Part 2: Paper 

Networks are a collection of points joined together singly or in pairs by lines. These points are knowns as nodes (or vertices) and the connecting lines are vertices. Edges represent a relationship between points and are a directed and asymmetric edge - there is a specific direction from node to node that reveals information about their relationship. A degree represents the number of edges connected to a node. Networks can be bimodal/bipartite with two types of nodes and multimodal with multiple nodes. A community within a network refers to the most relevant nodes to a specific node (Weingart, JDH, 2012). 

The data used to create this network was derived from a set of U.S. Supreme Court cases from 1754 to 2002. This entire data set contains 30,288 majority rulings each of which were assigned a corresponding legal issue. The network has been closely analyzed by legal experts and as a result can reveal patterns as well as predictions for future rulings. It also touches on the importance of precedent and how this shapes the legal decisions and the judiciary branch as a whole. 

This specific network includes data from issues regarding The First Amendment, miscellaneous (cf. comity: First Amendment) and comity: First Amendment, with issue numbers 30010 and 90030 respectively. Based on this data, the created network provides insights into how these cases and precedents are connected through co-citations, in which two cases are connected with an edge when five or more other cases cite them together. The cases themselves appear as nodes. The network reveals important decisive cases with potential legal ramifications including the central node, The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People V. Button, Attorney General of Virginia, Et. Al. (1962)., and gatekeepers, including Freedman V. Maryland (1964). From another perspective, the amount of cases that this network includes also makes it difficult to analyze the various connections in their entirety. Additionally, not having full and immediate knowledge of each and every case included in this network makes it difficult to draw complete conclusions. 

I picked these sets of cases because of their current relevance regarding The First Amendment, specifically freedom of speech and its importance in today's media driven world. As a result of the current discussions around The First Amendments, it's freedoms and limitations, and effects on open social media platforms such as Facebook, it's imperative to understand what build the precedents behind related rulings. This network reveals various connections in terms of The First Amendment from gatekeepers to centrality and more. From this network, viewers can see the structures and verdicts that have helped shaped todayâ€™s decisions.

Networks themselves have limits and should be acknowledged in order to better understand what this data set means and doesn't reveal. There is both power and drawbacks in simplicity. As a result, this limitation can be reducing at times and drop out certain complexities. Networks also flatten time and do not always reveal varying degrees of important. Networks can also be limited by small demographics; however, this does not necessarily apply this specific network as it contains such a large and widespread data set. Overall, these complexities make it less clear what can be fully learned from networks (Weingart, JDH, 2012). Despite these limits, networks also create other possibilities. Large amounts of data may not be ideal for other types of methods, but it is for networks. Adding mapping can also reveal changes over time (Newman, Oxford Scholarship Online, 2010). Regardless of their limitations, networks as a whole can offer great insights into data sets and uncover hidden ways that they are connected.
