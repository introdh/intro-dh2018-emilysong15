## Analysis

My Storymap tracks my location both on and off campus at the University of Richmond from Monday, November 5th, 2018 to Monday, November 12th, 2018. The storymap takes viewers through a week in my life from a spatial perspective. The places where I spend my time reflect elements of who I am as a student, individual, and member of the community as a whole. This map gives those exploring it various insights into how space represents more than simply a standing building or location. Simultaneously, creating this map through tracking and organizing my personal data has painted a larger picture for me personally in terms of what these places mean to me and why. I chose to focus on showing my map from the inside out, focusing first on my educational perspective through the classes I take and moving outwards to the place I live on campus and further into exploring the actual city of Richmond. Displaying my location points in this way gives viewers a direct look into my individual experience as not only a business student, but also as a twenty-one-year-old who has lived in Richmond for almost four years. 

GIS and spatial analysis offer new perspectives into space and place and the ways in which they impact our everyday lives. However, these methods do have their challenges. While place is simply a physical location, space refers to that same location with our perceptions that result from various layers of political and social constructs. According to David Bodenhamer, "All spaces contain embedded stories based on what has happened there. These stories are both individual and collective, and each of them links geography (space) and history (time). More important, they all reflect the values and cultural codes present in the various political and social arrangements that provide structure to society. In this sense, then, the meaning of space, especially as place or landscape, is always being constructed through the various contests that occur over power" (Bodenhamer, Beyond GIS). As a result of these preexisting perceptions, it is difficult to present my map to viewers in a way that is not bias. Because these locations are so personal to me, my descriptions along with the location create another layer of my storymap. While this gives viewers additional details to contribute to their understanding of my personal storymap, it only offers my distinct perspective as these spaces relate to my own life. Looking at another student's storymap could completely flip the viewers understanding of a specific building on campus that is also featured in my storymap. It is important to recognize these differences and include these challenges in my analysis so that viewers understand the personal connections we have to place, and how this can alter our perspectives. 

This idea of perspective also contributes to the constraints and limits of spatial analysis and GIS. These methods cannot stand alone - context is a necessary element of understanding the project. Without descriptions and insights directly from the creator, a storymap is difficult to follow and offers little to no meaning to the viewer. Additionally, mapping is an art form. As a result, the pieces are not completely neutral and contain a resulting bias. There is power in perspective (Crampton, Wiley-Blackwell, 2010).

Despite these limits, spatial analysis, GIS, and specifically storymapping offer great possibilities. These methods are forms of knowledge production that give great insight in terms of varying perspectives regarding the world around us. As a result, we can further challenge and question existing social norms and constructs. Spatial analysis is a unique way to conduct research and gain new information about both place and space and how the two impact our society. This technique allows for further questions and studies and ultimately reveals the great power that lies with perspective, both individually and collectively.
