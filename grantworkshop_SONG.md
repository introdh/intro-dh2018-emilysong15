# Grant Workshop

## Humanities Question 
How do our fashion related searches reflect social changes and developments in our society? 

## Abstract 
This project seeks to explore our search patterns over time as they relate to the fashion industry. How have our searches changed throughout the years? What do these changes mean in terms of the ways our society has grown and changed over time? This project, similar to the structure of [The Rhythm of Food](http://rhythm-of-food.net/), will gather patterns from search results and organizie them accordingly. The project will include forms of topic modeling, text analysis, maps, graphs, charts and interactive features. These methods will allows users to better understand the data presented by the project in a way that is both visually interesting and engaging. The results from this data can be used to further analyze the growth and development of the fashion industry, while providing users with specific information to gage a better understanding of women's rights, gender norms, and more.
